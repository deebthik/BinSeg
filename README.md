|---BinSeg: Leveraging Semantic Segmentation for Code and Data Separation in Non-Standard Binary Formats---|

Research internship at NYU-AD under Dr. M. Mikhail and B. Hadjer. In this project we aimed to automate one of the stages of binary analysis, code and data separation. Our method converted the binary files into images using space-filling curves. Next, our method leveraged image-based machine learning algorithms to perform semantic segmentation to identify the data and code sections of binary images. We train our model using Deeplab on known binary formats and then test it on binary files of non-standard formats. Our results show that the trained model had achieved a maximum accuracy ranging between 91.91% and 89.22% depending on the underlying methodology used for interpreting binary files.
